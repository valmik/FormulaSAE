B18 was built from Fall 2017 to Spring 2018, and will compete in June 2018. I lead R&D efforts on inverted carbon axles, and did a bunch of testing and computational analysis. The scripts I used are

    The axle strength code from B17.

    Damping testing code which analyzed and fit strain gauge data from our axle excitation testing

    A much more detailed packaging script (in Python instead of Matlab)

    short scripts for bonds and carbon wheel rims
