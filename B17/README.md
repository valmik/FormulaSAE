B17 was built from Fall 2016 to Spring 2017, and competed in June 2017. I designed the axle system for this car, and wrote a couple scripts for design and packaging:

    I used Eric Noordam's StaticsCalc and referenced John Corvello's axle calculation scripts to analyze carbon, steel, and aluminum tubes for strength and stiffness

    I wrote a Matlab script to make sure that the axles would remain constrained through the entire suspension travel. This involved lots of geometry and a little kinematics
